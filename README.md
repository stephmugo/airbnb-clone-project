## Team Roles
Backend Developer: Designs and implements API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic to support core functionalities like user management, bookings, and payments.

Database Administrator: Oversees database design, indexing, and optimization to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.

DevOps Engineer: Manages deployment, monitoring, and scaling of backend services, ensuring high availability and performance.

QA Engineer: Tests backend functionalities to ensure they meet quality standards and perform reliably under various conditions.

## Tech Stack
Django: A Python web framework used for building secure and scalable RESTful APIs.

Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs with support for CRUD operations.

PostgreSQL: A relational database for storing user, property, booking, and payment data.

GraphQL: Enables flexible and efficient data querying, reducing over- or under-fetching of data.

Celery: Handles asynchronous tasks like sending notifications or processing payments.

Redis: Supports caching and session management to improve performance.

Docker: Ensures consistent development and deployment environments through containerization.

CI/CD Pipelines: Automates testing and deployment to streamline development and ensure code quality.

## Database Design
Users

id: Unique identifier for each user.
email: User’s email for authentication and communication.
name: User’s full name for profile display.
password: Hashed password for secure authentication.
created_at: Timestamp for user registration.


Properties:

id: Unique identifier for each property.
host_id: Foreign key linking to the user who owns the property.
title: Name or title of the property.
location: Address or coordinates of the property.
price_per_night: Cost of renting the property per night.


Bookings:

id: Unique identifier for each booking.
property_id: Foreign key linking to the booked property.
user_id: Foreign key linking to the user making the booking.
check_in_date: Start date of the booking.
check_out_date: End date of the booking.


Reviews:

id: Unique identifier for each review.
property_id: Foreign key linking to the reviewed property.
user_id: Foreign key linking to the user posting the review.
rating: Numerical rating (e.g., 1-5 stars).
comment: Text description of the review.


Payments:

id: Unique identifier for each payment.
booking_id: Foreign key linking to the associated booking.
amount: Payment amount.
status: Payment status (e.g., pending, completed).
created_at: Timestamp of the payment.

## Relationships
A User can own multiple Properties (one-to-many).
A Property can have multiple Bookings and Reviews (one-to-many).
A Booking belongs to one User and one Property (many-to-one).
A Review is associated with one User and one Property (many-to-one).
A Payment is linked to one Booking (one-to-one).

## Feature Breakdown
User Management: Allows users to register, authenticate, and manage profiles, ensuring secure access to the platform.

Property Management: Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings, making it easy to manage rental offerings.

Booking System: Facilitates property reservations, including check-in/check-out details, providing a seamless booking experience.

Payment Processing: Handles secure payment transactions for bookings, ensuring trust and reliability.

Review System: Allows users to post and view property reviews, enhancing transparency and user confidence.

Data Optimization: Implements indexing and caching to improve data retrieval speed and reduce database load.

API Documentation: Provides clear REST and GraphQL API documentation, simplifying integration for developers.

## API Security
Authentication: Uses token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to verify user identity, protecting endpoints from unauthorized access.

Authorization: Implements role-based access control to ensure users only access resources they are permitted to, safeguarding sensitive data.

Rate Limiting: Restricts the number of API requests per user to prevent abuse and maintain system stability.

Data Protection: Encrypts sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, payment details) to prevent breaches and ensure compliance.

Importance:

User Data: Securing personal information builds trust and complies with privacy regulations.

Payments: Protecting transactions prevents fraud and ensures financial integrity.

System Integrity: Preventing unauthorized access and abuse maintains platform reliability.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the testing, building, and deployment of code changes, ensuring rapid and reliable delivery of updates. They are crucial for maintaining code quality, catching bugs early, and enabling seamless scaling. Tools like GitHub Actions can run automated tests, while Docker ensures consistent environments for deployment.
